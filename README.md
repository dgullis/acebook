### Description

The legacy codebase [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/acebook-mern-vite) provided routes for a user to login and sign up.

Over two weeks as a team we developed the following user features

- create new posts with text +/- an image
- edit and delete own posts
- like/unlike and comment on posts
- view all posts from users on a feed page
- edit bio and profile picture
- befriend other users
- notifications for new friends / comments / likes

### Working Process

Embracing Agile methodologies involving iterative development cycles, daily stand-ups and sprint planning to define and prioritise tasks. Organised workflow through a ticket system to ensure tracking and management of tasks throughout the project.
